Title: Optimization and importance sampling for Stan.

Description: A small package containing a 3 step routine for fitting Stan models, and limited diagnostics. For complex models where the maximum a-posteriori estimate provides a useful starting point, this approach may allow for faster fitting. The optional step 1 uses differential evolution, linking to the DEoptim package. Step 2 then uses the Stan optimizer. Step 3 computes a more accurate (my limited experience) Hessian or approximation of the Hessian, and uses this either for:     a) directly sampling from, for fast but inaccurate representation of the posterior.    b) as the basis for an initial target distribution for an adaptiveimportance sampling procedure.
